As you see above, we have some sales data in an excel sheet. Using this data, Power BI helps you build different charts and graphs to visualize the data.

Now that you have learned what is Power BI, let us now understand why Power BI is required.

## ↳ Why Power BI?

Following are the reasons why Power BI is so popular and needed in the BI domain:

**1. Access to Volumes of Data from Multiple Sources**

+ Power BI can access vast volumes of data from multiple sources. It allows you to view, analyze, and visualize vast quantities of data that cannot be opened in Excel. Some of the important data sources available for Power BI are Excel, CSV, XML, JSON, pdf, etc. Power BI uses powerful compression algorithms to import and cache the data within the.PBIX file.

**2. Interactive UI/UX Features** 

+ Power BI makes things visually appealing. It has an easy drag and drops functionality, with features that allow you to copy all formatting across similar visualizations.

**3. Exceptional Excel Integration** 

+ Power BI helps to gather, analyze, publish, and share Excel business data. Anyone familiar with Office 365 can easily connect Excel queries, data models, and reports to Power BI Dashboards.

**4. Accelerate Big Data Preparation with Azure** 

+ Using Power BI with Azure allows you to analyze and share massive volumes of data. An azure data lake can reduce the time it takes to get insights and increase collaboration between business analysts, data engineers, and data scientists.

**5. Turn Insights into Action** 

+ Power BI allows you to gain insights from data and turn those insights into actions to make data-driven business decisions.

**6. Real-time Stream Analytics**

+ Power BI will enable you to perform real-time stream analytics. It helps you fetch data from multiple sensors and social media sources to get access to real-time analytics, so you are always ready to make business decisions.

Now, in this what is Power BI article, you will learn about the architecture of Power BI.

## ↳ Advantages Of Power BI

**1) User-friendly interface:** Power BI has an intuitive interface allowing users to visualize and analyze data easily.

**2) Data integration:** Power BI allows users to easily integrate data from various sources, including Excel, SQL Server, and cloud-based sources like Azure and Salesforce.

**3) Customizable dashboards:** Users can create customized dashboards and reports to display data in a way that is meaningful to them.

**4) Real-time data:** Power BI supports real-time data processing, which means users can view up-to-date data in their dashboards and reports.

**5) Collaboration:** Power BI allows users to share their dashboards and reports with others, making collaborating on data analysis projects easy.

## ↳ Disadvantages Of Power BI

**1) Limited data processing capabilities:** Power BI is not designed for heavy-duty data processing and may struggle with large datasets or complex queries.

**2) Limited customization options:** While Power BI offers a range of customization options, users may find that they are limited in their ability to create truly unique visualizations and reports.

**3) Cost:** Power BI is not a free tool, and users may need to pay for additional features or storage space.

## ↳ Power BI Architecture

Power BI architecture is a service built on top of Azure. There are multiple data sources that Power BI can connect to. Power BI Desktop allows you to create reports and data visualizations on the dataset. Power BI gateway is connected to on-premise data sources to get continuous data for reporting and analytics. Power BI services refer to the cloud services that are used to publish Power BI reports and data visualizations. Using Power BI mobile apps, you can stay connected to their data from anywhere. Power BI apps are available for Windows, iOS, and Android platforms.

## ↳ Power BI Service

Power BI service is the Software as a Service (SaaS) part of Power BI. It is also known as Power BI Online. To access Power BI Service, you need to log in to Power BI service. 

Here is how the home page of Power BI Service looks like once you log in:

It allows you to connect to data, create reports and dashboards, and ask questions about your data.

Now, as you have understood what is Power BI, its architecture, and services, let us now understand about Dashboards in Power BI.

## ↳ Power BI Dashboard

Power BI Dashboard is a single page visualization to tell a story. The visualizations on a dashboard are generated from reports, and each report is based on one dataset. A single page dashboard is known as a Canvas. Below is a Finance Dashboard published on Power BI Service.

The visualizations you see on the dashboard are called Tiles and are pinned to the dashboard by report designers.

Power BI allows you to create different reports on Power BI Desktop. These reports can be published on the Power BI dashboard using the Power BI service. A Power BI report created on Power BI Desktop can be published on to Power BI Service by clicking on the Publish button. 

## ↳ Components of Power BI

**1) Power Query** 

+ Power Query is the data transformation and mash up the engine. It enables you to discover, connect, combine, and refine data sources to meet your analysis need. It can be downloaded as an add-in for Excel or can be used as part of the Power BI Desktop.

**2) Power Pivot** 

+ Power Pivot is a data modeling technique that lets you create data models, establish relationships, and create calculations. It uses Data Analysis Expression (DAX) language to model simple and complex data.

**3) Power View** 

+ Power View is a technology that is available in Excel, Sharepoint, SQL Server, and Power BI. It lets you create interactive charts, graphs, maps, and other visuals that bring your data to life. It can connect to data sources and filter data for each data visualization element or the entire report.

**4) Power Map** 

+ Microsoft's Power Map for Excel and Power BI is a 3-D data visualization tool that lets you map your data and plot more than a million rows of data visually on Bing maps in 3-D format from an Excel table or Data Model in Excel. Power Map works with Bing maps to get the best visualization based on latitude, longitude, or country, state, city, and street address information.

**5) Power BI Desktop** 

+ Power BI Desktop is a development tool for Power Query, Power Pivot, and Power View. With Power BI Desktop, you have everything under the same solution, and it is easier to develop BI and data analysis experience.

**6) Power Q&A**

+ The Q&A feature in Power BI lets you explore your data in your own words. It is the fastest way to get an answer from your data using natural language. An example could be what was the total sales last year? Once you've built your data model and deployed that into the Power BI website, then you can ask questions and get answers quickly.

## ↳ Who Uses Power BI Applications?

Power BI is used by a wide range of industries and organizations, including healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing. Users of Power BI applications include business analysts, data analysts, data scientists, and other professionals who need to analyze and visualize data.

Now, to better understand what is Power BI, and how does it helps, let us look at a case study on how Meijer, which is one of the United States' largest supermarket chains, used Power BI to solve its business problems.
